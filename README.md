# Neovim for writing

This is my neovim configuration made for writing markdown notes and simple documents. It has git integration to detect changes, and a writing mode with multilinguagem support. Also have markdown shortcuts and preview with zathura to make file editing easier. 

For theming it grabs colors from the [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) color pallete.

**Dependencies:**
For the markdown preview `zathura`, `zathura-pdf-poppler` and `pandoc` need to be installed.
